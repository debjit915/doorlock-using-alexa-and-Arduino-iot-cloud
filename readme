🔐 ESP32 Smart Door Lock with Alexa and Motion Detection
This project integrates an ESP32, a servo motor, and a PIR motion sensor to create a smart door locking system that can be controlled via Alexa (Arduino IoT Cloud) and also responds to motion automatically.

When motion is detected (someone comes near the door), the servo unlocks the door automatically. You can also control the lock manually using the Alexa app or voice assistant.

🚀 Features
✅ Alexa voice control via Arduino IoT Cloud

✅ Auto door unlock on motion detection

✅ Real-time status updates

✅ Servo motor-based door locking

✅ Serial monitoring for debugging and status
